# Fixed Income Assets

Scripted solutions used in my MBA for fixed income analysis, and asset securitization projects


## Description

Personal playground to attempt our homework problems in python as opposed to Excel.
These are not assignment answers nor do I advocate using them for solving homework problems.
They are purely for  educational and entertainment purposes.


## Prerequisites

There are a number of common and likely a handful of obscure python modules used by these scripts.
They will be called out for in the prereq section of each respective script directory.


## Script Threading

As these scripts mature there will be scripts that rely on the existence of support ie ancillary scripts. When this is the case it will be called out in the readme of each respective script directory. When this is the case the directories would need to be kept as the same names and locations as they are present in this repo.
